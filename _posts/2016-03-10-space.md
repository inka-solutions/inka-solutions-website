## Requirements Game

For the last 10 years I have been more of an anaylst than a programmer and I wanted to share some of my experiences with you.

After all this time of gathering requirements and after the countless inevitable missed requirements for any large project, I still today find myself getting excited by the solution and tailoring my requirements around it rather than the other way around.  It was just very recently that I noticed myself doing this and because of this I am thinking about getting back into development.

## Where to begin?

As an analyst for backend REST services, logic would suggest that I delevop services and rest APIs, however its pretty boring isnt it?  Its all black screens and creaming your pants over 11000TPS with just 4 nodes - no, Im worth more than that, I want bright colours and animation therefore Im starting with AngularJS and SASS.

### Really Queen?

I know it sounds crazy, but actually, I just to do a fair bit of Javascript development back in the day so Im hoping getting back into it will be easier.  The market is saturated with acronyms that I dont understand, so finding something that sounds comfortable is already a small step forward.
